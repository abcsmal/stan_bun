The code is a raytracing exercise

Compile the code with make (tested to work on machines Maari-C, some links in
directory structure expect that).

After that you start the program by giving the command
./bin/raytrace

As defualt the program uses bos.ply file and cannot be run from
the bin folder.

## Completed

* Adapted our mesh loader from previous exercise (1p)

You can choose ply file to use with -f <name_of_plyfile>
included files are box.ply and bun_zipper_res4.ply

* Shadow test (1p)
* Simple indirect lightning (1p)
* Complex indirect lightning (russian roulette) (1p)

Our russian roulette is slightly modified from the one presented in the lecture 
slides: a ray shot from the camera (and not bounced) is always bounced at least 
once to reduce noise. We take this into account and do not multiply by 2 to 
preserve the unbiased nature of the estimator.

You can disable indirect lightning with the option -i

* Acceleration structure (bounding volume hierarchy) (3p)

You can turn the accelerator off with -a option

The performance gain is with a bunny:
    Using 2 stanford bunnies of 948 faces (triangles) and a Core2Duo 6600
    machine

    Rendered scene with 614400 rays in 21 seconds with 29257.142857 rays/sec
    Rendered scene with 614400 rays in 506 seconds with 1214.229249 rays/sec
    
    guess which is which?

The bounding volume hierarchy is built using bounding sphere geometries. The 
object's triangles are divided into two equal size child objects and the bounding 
sphere counted for them. The triangles are not ordered. It is hoped that nearby 
triangles are adjacent in the file format. This loop is continued until there is
one triangle in the child. A shot ray is then tested down the tree to find where
it may hit.

* perfect mirror reflection and glass reflection (1p)

You can turn one sphere to a mirror with the option -m
The option -g adds a glass sphere in front of the two other speheres

* phong shader (1p)

Turn the phong shader function on with the option -p
This will turn one sphere into a black phong shaded sphere. There is quite a bit
of noise on the sphere as was to be expected.

* quasirandom (1p)

Turn quasirandom off with the option -q
At the moment only small differences can be seen, there is some patterns showing
up in the spheres. But we cannot be sure if the patterns shown are correct.

## Additional features

You can print out help with the option -h

You can choose how many rays per pixel will be used with the option -n <rays_per_pixel>

## Known problems

* The mesh loader might crash if there is some problems with the format of the 
file or comments in the file.
* Does not work on minilaptops, some problems with memory and graphic cards.
* Command line option parsing is not robust, can crash easily 
* We do not turn the normals of the bunny or other ply objects
